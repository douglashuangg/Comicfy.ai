Bring your stories to life using Comicfy.ai!

Built using WomboAI's image generative AI to generate a comic strip on any story or text. Utilized Cohere's natural language processing to get the sentiment of the text and selecting a music piece that matches the mood. Used React for the frontend and Python/FastAPI in the backend.
