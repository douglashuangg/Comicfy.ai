Bring your stories to life using Comicfy.ai!

Built using WomboAI's image generative AI to generate a comic strip on any story or text. In order to speed up the generation of multiple images, multithreading was incorporated in order to make multiple API requests to Wombo's API. Utilized Cohere's natural language processing to get the sentiment of the text and select a music piece that matches the mood. Used React for the frontend and Python/FastAPI in the backend.
